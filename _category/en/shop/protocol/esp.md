description: "ESP32 is a series of system-on-a-chip (SoC) type microcontrollers from Espressif Systems, based on Tensilica's Xtensa LX6 architecture, integrating Wi-Fi and Bluetooth management (up to LE 5.0 and 5.11) in dual mode, and a DSP. It is an evolution of ESP8266 which is a microcontroller integrated circuit with Wi-Fi connection developed by the Chinese manufacturer Espressif1. ESP8266 is a microcontroller integrated circuit with Wi-Fi connection developed by the Chinese manufacturer Espressif1.

In August 2014, electronics enthusiasts began to take an interest in the ESP-01 version of this integrated circuit produced by a third-party company, AI-Thinker. This one, of reduced size, makes it possible to connect a microcontroller to a Wi-Fi network and to establish TCP/IP connections with Hayes commands. The progressive translation of the documentation (originally only in Chinese) motivated by the low price of the circuit allowed the development of a community of developers and enthusiasts of the ESP82662.

At the end of October 2014, Espressif offered a software development kit (SDK) allowing the circuit to be programmed without resorting to the use of an additional microcontroller. Since then, Espressif has released many new versions of the SDK in two variants: one based on FreeRTOS3 and another based on callbacks.

Fuzix OS, a very lightweight Unix developed by Alan Cox, runs on this platform, ported by Hjalfi4.

In November 2020, Espressif announced the release of the ESP32-C3, WiFi & BLE, a processor in line with the ESP32, but pin-to-pin compatible with the ESP8266, and using the 32-bit RISC-V architecture 5."
