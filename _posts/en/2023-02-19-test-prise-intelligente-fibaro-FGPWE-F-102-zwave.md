Fibaro has always been a manufacturer of Z-wave modules **of very high quality**, they know how to combine **aesthetics and functionality**, just look at the switches they provide, *simply Magnificent*.

Below are 3 pictures of Z-wave 700 FGWPE/F-102 Fibaro smart socket. Besides, for that **I would like to thank Domadoo** who allowed me to carry out this test. At first glance this shot does not present anything exceptional *so what could justify this price.* ðŸ¤”

# Variants

The socket is available in Eu France and Eu German version known as Schuco, I advise you to take the **Schuco version** if available because backward compatibility is greater, you will encounter fewer problems with your additional accessories.

# know socket status with colors

This is how Fibaro stands out from its competitors thanks to color, but does it justify the price difference?
After integration, when you unplug the plug and plug it back in, if it briefly lights up green, it is recognized in the network, if it is red, resume your inclusion. (The inclusion is done simply by connecting the mains plug).

## in the network

Hold down for the time that the socket flashes purple, then a colored indication appears.

- If **vert**{: .green} you are connected directly to the key
- In **yellow**{: .yellow} you are connected to a router
- In **purple**{: .purple} communication is limited
- In **red**{: .red} there is no signal

## of consumption

if the consumption is:

- Instant 80w color will be **blue**{: .blue}
- Instant 210w color will be **green**{: .green}
- 550w instant the color will be **yellow**{: .yellow}
- 1250w instant the color will be **orange**{: .orange}
- 2000w instant the color will be **red**{: .red}

# The module in Homeassistant with ZwaveJS

Everything is functional, however a shell at the Firmware level is recognized as Unknown, I did not look into the question especially since in Jeedom it is well recognized.

**Thanks to ZwaveJS, the Fibaro fgpw-102** smart plug brings up information from:

- Power
- Instantaneous consumption in W
- Total consumption in Kwh

> More a whole battery of Parameters and Diagnostics in short than Happiness.

# the module in Jeedom + ZwaveJS

For everyone's happiness, Jeedom also uses the excellent ZwaveJS, it also brings up all the consumption info, however a little more to Jeedom Luna **it does bring up the Firmware info.**

We also have access **to the different parameters** of the module, the Z-wave is still great, especially at the level of the mesh

> **PS:** under Jeedom I encountered latency when refreshing information, unlike Homeassistant where the status feedback is more reactive.

# Conclusion

If at home you only use the Z-wave network then you are used to spending a fortune for a single module, then if this is your case the Fibaro FGPWE/P-102 is for you without a doubt. For the others, there is Neo-Coolcam, which makes a similar module for half the price, but the **manufacturing quality and the quantity of parameters** are not at all the same.
