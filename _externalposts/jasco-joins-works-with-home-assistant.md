<p>Today we are excited to announce that <a href="https://byjasco.com">Jasco</a> has joined the Works with Home Assistant program as a Z-Wave partner.</p>
<p>Jasco is well known in the US for their Z-Wave switches and plugs. As a partner, Jasco and Nabu Casa will be working together to ensure the best experience for connecting Jasco Z-Wave devices to Home Assistant.</p>
<p>Jasco devices connect and integrate into Home Assistant using the Z-Wave integration (Z-Wave stick required). This means that connected Jasco devices work completely local and updates coming from the device are instantaneously reflected in Home Assistant. This allows for the best user experience when building your smart home.</p>

<p>One of Jascoâ€™s claim to fame in the Home Assistant community is being the first company to <a href="https://building.open-home.io/open-home-birthday-special/#automatic-updates-for-z-wave-devices">provide firmware files</a> (for 77 devices!) to the Z-Wave JS firmware update server. This service is used by Home Assistant to keep your devices secure. It is used to automatically detect if any of your Z-Wave devices have an updated firmware available and offer users to upgrade it.</p>
