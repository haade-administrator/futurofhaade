JEEDOM LUNA is the new home automation box integrating Jeedom software. Little sister of the JEEDOM ATLAS, it was designed to offer a still innovative home automation solution, but at a reduced cost.

**With its 64-bit 4-core processor**, its 2 GB DDR3 RAM and its 16 GB emmc hard drive, the JEEDOM LUNA is ready to support most home automation installations. You will be able to manage many aspects of your home, from lighting to heating, including roller shutters, gates, etc.

# Great wireless connectivity
To take advantage of updates and remote control, the JEEDOM LUNA plugs into an Ethernet port of your router or your ADSL box. But it is also equipped with Wi-Fi technology, which allows you to place it wherever you want in your home.

The JEEDOM LUNA can manage your Zigbee and Z-Wave home automation networks thanks to its internal controllers. With its new Z-Wave 700 series chip and the Z-Wave JS plugin, the JEEDOM LUNA is ready to support the latest Z-Wave developments: S2 and SmartStart. As for its Zigbee chip, it is ready to support Thread and Matter!

# Almost limitless scalability
If you need to add other home automation protocols, it is quite possible. The USB port of the JEEDOM LUNA is made for that! Connect the USB antenna of your choice and download the appropriate plugin. If you need more USB ports, a powered USB hub is required.

JEEDOM is a universal and scalable solution that works on the plugin principle. Each home automation protocol, each connectivity with other projects can be integrated into JEEDOM by adding a plugin. The JEEDOM LUNA is a HUB which allows you to centralize all of your connected objects.

**Service Pack Power included**
The JEEDOM LUNA home automation box is supplied with the Power Service Pack of the Jeedom software. This includes services not available in the DIY (Community) version. Thus, the Alarm plugin, the mobile application and remote access by secure DNS are included.

# Customizable
JEEDOM has a web interface for configuring your home automation, and a mobile application (iOS and Android) for use from smartphones and tablets. JEEDOM is also fully customizable according to your needs using widgets, views, designs, virtual devices, scenarios, or even plugins... Remotely, locally, by voice, sms, or even touch, you can control your home at any time and be alerted to an event.

# Controllable by voice
Voice assistants from Amazon and Google are compatible with the JEEDOM LUNA. You will be able to control your home simply by voice.

# Built-in backup battery
The JEEDOM LUNA is equipped with an integrated backup battery. Thus in the event of a power cut, it remains operational. This also avoids the risk of malfunction after a sudden cut.
