After the Sonoff switches in the TX range **( T0, T1, T2 and T3)**, the Chinese manufacturer released the **TX Ultimate** series in 2023, nothing to do with the rest of the range. A very, very well finished product **with a range of exceptional options and customizations.**

{% include product-embed.html image="sonoff-tx-ultimate-t5-86.png" title="TX Ultimate" brand="Sonoff" description="Intelligent and ultra-customizable switch 1, 2 or 3 keys sound and light shell Ultimate TX T5-86" iteadlink="sonoff-tx-ultimate-smart-touch-wall-switch" domlink="peripheriques/6740-interrupteur-mural-tactile-intelligent-tx-ultimate-2-touches-sonoff.html" affiliate="_DDOhoQz" %}

## Unboxing the Sonoff {{ page.ref }}

{% picture posts/{{ page.guid }}/deballage-interrupteur-sonoff-tx-ultimate-t5-2C-86.png --alt unboxing of the Sonoff du tx ultimate T5-C3-86 by Sonoff European version --img width="940" height="529" %}

Exceptional European-level packaging ðŸ˜€, inside you will find the wall switch in a blister with a protective film on the front of the switch. The first impression that emerges from this product is of exceptional quality, the product is very well finished and the top shell (white) has a satin feel. The LED strip under the switch is very well integrated.
*ps:domadoo provided me with a T5-2C-86 double switch*

{% picture posts/{{ page.guid }}/face-arriere-sonoff-tx-ultimate.png --alt rear side of the tx-ultimate by Sonoff European version --img width="940" height="529" %}

Opening the Sonoff switch {{ page.ref }} is done without forcing, once the 4 screws have been removed you will have access to the printed circuit.

{% picture posts/{{ page.guid }}/demontage-sonoff-tx-ultimate.png --alt disassembly of the tx-ultimate by Sonoff European version --img width="940" height="529" %}

You can see that Sonoff has not skimped on the number of LEDs, UART access is offered in order to be able to upload customized firmware, on the right is a vibration module.

## Commissioning the Sonoff {{ page.ref }}

Good like the rest of the Wifi range if you want to use this product you will need to download the Ewelink application available on [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coolkit&hl=fr&gl=US){: target="_blank"} and [Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/ewelink-smart-home/id1035163158){: target="_blank"}.

**The Ewelink application is very well done**, integrating the modules is hassle-free, if this is your first Sonoff module, start by creating an account. You will see a little further down that it is possible to integrate it into home assistant thanks to HACS and SonoffLan but it will still be necessary to integrate it into the Ewelink app beforehand.
**There is, however, one drawback** when using this application, which is the fact that you use a Chinese cloud to control the Sonoff range wifi modules.

{%- include alert.html type="info" text="When operating via <b>the Ewelink application</b>, activating a switch will not cause sounds or vibrations <b>only light</b> will be available <b>unlike the 'physical activation</b>." %}

When searching for Wifi, a blue light flashes on the top of the module then ends up turning off once connected to the network.

{%- include alert.html type="info" text="The interchangeable covers <b>are not available at domadoo</b> however you can obtain them directly from Itead or on the Aliexpress purchase link" link="https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-tx-ultimate-smart-touch-wall-switch-cover/ref/122/" textlink="Achats des Covers pour TX Ultimate chez Itead" %}

## Characteristics of Sonoff {{ page.ref }}

{% picture posts/{{ page.guid }}/sonoff-tx-ultimate-cartoon-eclairage-led-presentation.png --alt Cartoon and light atmosphere of tx ultimate by Sonoff European version --img width="940" height="529" %}

**The switch will delight your eyes and ears**, firstly the responsiveness of the keys is sensational and **on the entire surface**, very responsive, you just need to touch the key for it to it turns on, *noise*, *vibration* and *led light* will activate just that, **negative point you will not be able to deactivate these options they are for the moment inseparable.**

View of the switch **with the Star shell installed**, changing the shell is quite easy

{% picture posts/{{ page.guid }}/sonoff-tx-ultimate-star-eclairage-led-presentation.png --alt Star and light atmosphere of tx ultimate by Sonoff European version --img width="940" height="529" %}

Second point **you can configure the LED display** outside of the operation of the switches, and thus illuminate the module permanently. This option offers 8 different themes: **(Night light, Party, Leisure, Color, Childhood, Wiper, Fairy, Starburst)**, you will definitely find lighting to suit you.

Below are the different LED lighting image themes available for this switch.

## Available Sonoff functions {{ page.ref }}

No less than 6 functions are available with this switch:

- Set of 8 LED lights
- Vibes
- Sounds during physical activation
- light under the switch activated
- interchangeable shells
- Actions Slide Left or Right

## Interchangeable Shells

Sonoff provides optional interchangeable shells, for the European version you have the choice between cartoon (cat/bear) or Star to spruce up your switch, the American version 120 offers a somewhat different Cartoon in my opinion more successful for a bedroom Boy.

{% picture posts/{{ page.guid }}/interrupteur-sonoff-tx-ultimate-plus-coque-cartoon-et-star-version-europeenne.png --alt presentation of tx ultimate cases by Sonoff European version --img width="940" height="529" %}

**European cartoon**, with its packaging

{% picture posts/{{ page.guid }}/coque-interchangeable-cartoon-sonoff-tx-ultimate-eu-86.png --alt presentation of the interchangeable cartoon tx ultimate case by Sonoff European version --img width="940" height="529" %}

**Star case** with its packaging.

{% picture posts/{{ page.guid }}/coque-interchangeable-star-sonoff-tx-ultimate-eu-86.png --alt presentation of the star tx ultimate interchangeable shell by Sonoff European version --img width="940" height="529" %}

Additional point, the Sonoff {{ page.ref }} is sold with a white shell but it is **possible to interchange it**, customization has almost no limits, the European version offers two shells as options [ Cartoon or Star](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-tx-ultimate-smart-touch-wall-switch-cover/ref/122/){: target="_blank"}, However, I regret the American version of the cartoon representing whale and coral, which is not available for the European version, the blue would correspond better to young boys.

## Miscellaneous connection of Sonoff 3 buttons

With the Sonoff TX Ultimate T-3C-86 you can control the motor or hot water tank, below are the connection diagrams.

{% picture posts/{{ page.guid }}/schema-branchement-sonoff-tx-ultimate-3-inter-moteur-chauffe-eau.png --alt connection diagram of the tx ultimate T5-C3-86 by Sonoff European version --img width="940" height="739" %}

Only **the 3 button version** allows you to control a motor or water heater provided that the latest firmware Min:1.3.1 is installed on the switch.

## Sonoff {{ page.ref }} and Home Assistant

{% picture posts/{{ page.guid }}/controle-homeassistant-sonofflan-interrupteur-sonoff-tx-ultimate-t5-2C-86.png --alt Control in Home-Assistant with Hacs and SonoffLan of Sonoff of tx ultimate T5-C3-86 by Sonoff European version --img width="940" height="529" %}

The switch is controllable via HomeAssistant thanks to **SonoffLAN** and HACS integration, [I wrote an article about this]({% post_url /en/2023-07-03-sonofflan-the-manager-sonoff-for-home-assistant %}){: target="_blank"}, read it and you will definitely succeed in the integration.

Good news The Sonoff TX-Ultimate **works at 95% without the Cloud**, in **Lan** mode everything is controllable **except slide 1 and 2**
In **Auto or Cloud** mode the Sonoff {{ page.ref }} **works at 100%**

{% picture posts/{{ page.guid }}/fonctionnemment-action-slide-Sonofflan-interrupteur-sonoff-tx-ultimate-t5-2C-86.png --alt operation Slide action Sonoff Lan auto and cloud mode of Sonoff tx ultimate T5-C3-86 by Sonoff European version --img width="940" height="529" %}

In **Auto or Cloud mode** the left and right slide is recognized, in **Lan mode** this is not the case for the moment [I posted a github issue on this subject](https://github.com/AlexxIT/SonoffLAN/issues/1328){: target="_blank}

During the **next update** of the SonoffLAN plugin you will be able to easily control the themes via home assistant, to carry out these tests I updated the SonoffLAN lights.py file

{%- include alert.html type="info" text="When operating via <b>SonoffLAN and Home Assistant</b>, activating a switch will not cause sounds or vibrations <b>only light</b> will be available <b>unlike the 'physical activation</b>." %}
