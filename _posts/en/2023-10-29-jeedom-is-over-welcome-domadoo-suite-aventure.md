In recent weeks a certain number of concerns and questions have been expressed about the[forum Jeedom](https://community.jeedom.com/t/ou-va-jeedom/110870/226){: target="_blank"} regarding the future and direction of the **Jeedom solution** while pointing out a lack of communication on the part of the team.

> Jeedom SAS no longer exists, in fact the company was bought at the end of September by Domadoo.

**According to Jeedom:**
One thing is certain, it is obvious that the community of Jeedom users and prescribers is very present, active and as passionate as ever, even if certain concerns concern subjects that have already been debated many times. We are therefore not going to respond to every point, however there is one on which the team is in complete agreement: it is undeniable that official communication is necessary, all the more so since for various reasons we do not We haven't been able to share with the community as much as we would have liked this year.

## Company transfer simplification

Since September 27, 2023, the Jeedom software and company belong to the home automation equipment sales company **Domadoo**.

## Orientation dedicated to professionals

Jeedom clearly announces on its blog a ***priority to professionals***, individuals should just watch out...

**According to Jeedom:**
> First of all, **although it will not please everyone**, it seems essential to take stock of the current economic functioning of Jeedom. In fact, the costs of infrastructure, services and payroll are only absorbed in a tiny part by sales of plugins or services to individuals. Most of the turnover necessary for the proper functioning of Jeedom is ensured by the provision of services and solutions of varying degrees of scale to professional customers. These projects for professionals therefore represent a large workload for the teams but also contribute significantly to the constant development of the Jeedom software.

## Aging Jeedom code

According to two major weaknesses constitute the Jeedom environment, On the one hand the core of Jeedom is built around php, I sincerely think that this type of language is not or no longer adapted to home automation systems, the constitution of a base of data is often heavy on requests and the fact of necessarily assimilating Nginx or Apache for core management are functional but much too long for calling code. Secondly, the graphical interface is far from being aesthetic and far from being UI Design oriented as one might find on other platforms. Finally, the sale of additional plugins, often paid for, is a hindrance for the lamda user, **especially since according to the company's words, I quote:**
> Indeed, the costs of infrastructure, services and payroll are only absorbed in a tiny part by sales of plugins or services to individuals

So **why not make these plugins free** at least those developed by Team Jeedom.

*The absence of answers on the forum as well as a set of hardware and software bugs are chilling the Jeedom community*

## Questions around Lo誰c

For those who remember **Lo誰c and the creator of Jeedom**, at the time Jeedom was a boon for French Geeks looking for a home automation system. When the company Jeedom SAS was created, Lo誰c probably did not want to join the company and I find that more than a shame, even if he is consulted and continues to work on the Jeedom core.

> Indeed we can see on its github page a blatant increase in contributions at the end of the year

**According to Jeedom: Let's move forward together**
To conclude, we are all united around Jeedom by passion at whatever level. It is obvious that we must be able to continually question ourselves, each in our own way, to continue to move forward together around this magnificent home automation solution and thus contribute to its sustainability.

**We, members of the Jeedom team**, sincerely hope to have been able to answer your questions and are counting on you, passionate users, to support us in the future developments of Jeedom. **What do you think ?**

## Conclusion

**According to Jeedom, there is no need to worry**, the growth of new users is still relevant. But we all know that we can **make the figures lie**, in fact are these users provided by certified Jeedom professionals or are they users who have made a personal choice when the use of this software. Personally I think that Jeedom has had its glory days but is evolving in the shadow of Home Assistant and probably Openhab, both programmed in Python for one and Java for the other, more modern and current languages.

Even if according to the Jeedom team, the merger between Jeedom SAS and Domadoo was inevitable, **the only way for Domadoo to get out of it is to continue to develop the solution for professionals, not individuals. Shame.**
