The radiator thermostat can be used with the majority of water radiators such as radiators, towel warmers or even underfloor heating. It takes readings from external Aqara sensors and adjusts the heating power accordingly.

**Zigbee 3.0 and Matter protocol support**
Enjoy the benefits of Zigbee 3.0, the fastest, most stable and most energy-efficient smart home technology and be sure of the future: the Aqara radiator thermostat will receive Matter support after its official release.

**External temperature sensor readings (including HomeKit)**
Control the temperature of the entire room, not just around the radiator. Compared to other thermostats, the Aqara radiator thermostat can receive temperature readings directly from the connected Aqara temperature and humidity sensor, even in HomeKit!

**Full compatibility**
Compatible with the most popular ecosystems and can be controlled by voice. Apple HomeKit, Alexa, Google, IFTTT, Alice, Marusya are supported.

**2 in 1 door and window opening detection**
To avoid wasting energy, the radiator thermostat will turn off the heating if an open door or window is detected. This can be done both based on the built-in temperature sensor which will detect a sudden temperature drop, or by connecting it to an Aqara door and window sensor via automations, which will be more reliable.

**Weather automation and frost protection**
If there is a risk of pipes freezing, the heating will turn on automatically. In addition, thanks to powerful Aqara Home automations, in the event of a sharp drop in the outside temperature, the room can be preheated to compensate for the temperature change.

**Configurable smart schedules**
Schedules can be set for desired time periods, such as nighttime, and the transition between them will be smooth but as quick as possible.

**Device grouping support**
If you have multiple radiators in a room, all will be synchronized in the most efficient way based on the actual temperature of the room.

**Colorful backlit display**
Compared to similar products, the Aqara radiator thermostat LCD screen has backlighting, increased viewing angles, very high contrast as well as crisp, colorful icons.

**1 year battery life**
No need to change batteries after a few weeks of use: thanks to the Zigbee protocol and energy-efficient hardware, the Aqara radiator thermostat battery can last up to a year.

**Geofencing and multi-home support**
If you have more than one house, you will be able to configure the independent automations for each of them and start heating before your arrival, so that when you enter the house it will already be warm.

**Easy installation and compatibility**
The Aqara radiator thermostat includes adapters which make it compatible with a large majority of radiator valves. As for installation, it only takes a few minutes and requires no additional tools.

**Note:** This device is an EU version and is intended for use with the EU version of an Aqara EU Hub.
