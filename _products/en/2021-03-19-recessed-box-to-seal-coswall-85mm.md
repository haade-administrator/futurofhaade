I had presented a little time ago the flush-mounting box for hollow partition, here it is available in a version to be sealed in all solid walls.

**Benefits of sealing coswall:**

1. Well-made materials
2. 85mm side and 48mm depth
3. Compatible with any 86mm side switch
4. snap together (multi-plug function)
5. the cost is very attractive.
