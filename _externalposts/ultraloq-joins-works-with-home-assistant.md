 Today we are excited to announce that Ultraloq by U-tec has joined the Works with Home Assistant program as a Z-Wave partner. 
 As a partner, U-tec and Nabu Casa will be working together to ensure the best experience for connecting Ultraloq Z-Wave smart locks to Home Assistant, including testing the actual products in the Nabu Casa labs. 

  
 Ultraloq smart locks connect and integrate into Home Assistant using the Z-Wave integration (Z-Wave stick required). This means that connected locks work completely local, and updates coming from the device are instantaneously reflected in Home Assistant. This allows for the best user experience when building your smart home. 
 Learn more about the Works with Home Assistant partner program.
