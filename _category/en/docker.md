description: "First Docker is a software platform that allows you to design, test and deploy applications quickly.

Docker packs software into standardized units called containers. Which bring together all the elements necessary for their operation. Including libraries, system tools, code and runtime environment. With Docker, you can easily deploy and scale applications. In any environment, with the assurance that your code will run correctly.
<br />
In conclusion, by using Docker, developers and administrators have a reliable and inexpensive way to develop. But also to deliver and run distributed applications at all scales.<br />
This is why we use it heavily in our home automation programs."
