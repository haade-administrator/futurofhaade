Another expected article, given the number of sales made by itead concerning the nspanel pro, **it doesn't surprise me**. Here I received for testing the new NSPanel pro 120 **provided by itead** and I thank them for it. I carried out some tests and made a comparison with the NSPanel pro 86 and you will see that the differences are not the least.

## Unpacking {{ page.ref }}

The packaging is relatively similar to the NSPanel Pro, so it is well packaged **which prevents breakage during transport**. The black screen protection foam is now glued to the cardboard.

The Sonoff {{ page.ref }} is **very good quality** I have nothing to complain about, you will be satisfied with the product once out of the blister, always delivered with instructions and a kit of two screws to install it.

> Be careful the location of the screws and to American standards, the rest is to European standards.

**Let's compare the NSPanel pro 86 and 120**. Apart from the totally different dimensions, we **will find other divergent points:**

1. the thickness of the screen is greater on the {{ page.ref }}
2. there is no protection module protecting the connection on the {{ page.ref }}
3. the electrical part that will be embedded in the flush-mounting box is slightly less imposing on the {{ page.ref }} and this is a good thing.
4. The total depth is similar between the two products.
5. the location of the screw fixings is in US format

## And the screen in all this?

Let's move on to **the display quality** because there is also a difference, so I must admit it is not so obvious on the photos.
But for the same contrast setting between the two products, the {{ page.ref }} offers a luminous depth and a superior contrast to the NSPanel Pro 86.

Big news of firmware V3.5.0, is the adaptation of **the portrait/landscape option only available on version 120**, you will not find it on version 86.

On the image below I took screenshots of the two display modes available. So you can see the advantage of having a larger screen. Also as noted above on these photos we will note an improved contrast and depth on the {{ page.ref }}.

It is less talked about, because in general we only have one NSPanel per home, **but it is possible to communicate directly between several NSPanels via the telephone interface**, ideal for large buildings or if we have one NSPanel per room. It may seem like a gadget at first glance but the option is nevertheless interesting.

## Sonoff Support {{ page.ref }}

If for some reason you can't install it on a wall mount, Sonoff offers a **plastic mount and it's the same for some time**, available in anthracite or white this mount is compatible with versions 86 and 120 of the NSPanel and NSPanel Pro. Great to put on a bedside table for example.

## Conclusion

Well I won't hide it from you, if you hesitate between the classic NSPanel pro (86) and the new {{ page.ref }}, **my choice is made and it's the 120 that wins**, normal, larger display and improved contrast. No surprise the {{ page.ref }} offers undeniable advantages, the 4.7'' of the screen are a real plus, the quality of the panel has been revised with more marked contrasts. Sul downside is the position of the fixings which are not compatible with European flush-mounting boxes.

> Still no **interactions with Opensource Home Automation boxes**.

For the rest everything is perfect.
