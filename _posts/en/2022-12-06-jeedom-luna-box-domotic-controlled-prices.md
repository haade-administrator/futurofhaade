Cut for efficiency at a lower cost, Jeedom Luna is nonetheless solid and fast with basic technical characteristics comparable to those of a Jeedom Smart (4 64-bit cores: Quad Cortex-A53 (1.5GHz) / 2GB DDR3) coupled with many additional features such as **Z-Wave and Zigbee home automation protocols integrated by default** as well as the backup battery to name a few.

## A significant plus, **the battery**

Once started, nothing will be able to stop your Jeedom Luna, in particular **thanks to its 6000mAh Lithium battery** which allows it to cope with power cuts without weakening. Of course, the autonomy will vary according to each type of installation but will, in all cases and with certainty, compensate for occasional power cuts. You should know that the box **held 7 days in a row** on battery with a "naked" Jeedom during our various tests, which suggests very good prospects.

Autonomy can still be pushed to its climax by **the addition of 4G LTE connectivity** (certified professionals only) which can act as a backup connection in the event of faulty internet access or even only access to outside if necessary.

## Regarding connectivity:

It is not left out with **the integration of Wi-Fi, a state-of-the-art Z-Wave + 700 series chip and a Zigbee 3.0 chip already compatible with Matter and Thread!** This progressive and multi-protocol aspect offers real freedom in the deployment of any home automation installation, while guaranteeing support for future modules and technologies.

Finally, other novelties not least, the presence of a power button as well as a reset hole which, if pressed for 10 seconds, will automatically restore the box to factory mode. Note also the light-emitting diodes on the top, **fixed green**{: .green} in operation or **flashing green**{: .green} when the box is being restored.

## First Custom Motherboard

> This is a first for Jeedom, that of designing a personalized branded motherboard, the old boxes run on prefabricated cards, such as **raspberrypi, rockpi or odroid**, they will be less dependent on manufacturing times, c is a real plus, a pity that it is not designed to integrate a CM4 (raspberry compute module 4) for even more versatility. **Too bad we don't see more info on this map.**
