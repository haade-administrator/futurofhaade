So why did we choose to present this product to you, and well because it has only one drawback, everything else is positive.

> Moes' zigbee-compatible touch switch looks a lot like Livolo's switch, however the 2020 upgrade and the touch interface make this product a very good switch and above all it stands out.

[**Commercial Link Moes Upgrade 2020 Switch**]({% link _products/{{ page.locale | slice: 0,2 }}/2021-03-18-zigbee-touch-switch-moes-zts-eu-upgrade-2020.md %})

As uncle says in the video, the Moes switch works under homeassistant with the zigbee2mqtt module from version 1.18.x.

## Coswall square recessed box ideal for new and old:

1. [recessed box 83mm hollow materials]({% link _products/{{ page.locale | slice: 0,2 }}/2021-03-18-square-recessed-box-coswall-placo.md %})
2. [Coswall 85mm flush-mounting box]({% link _products/{{ page.locale | slice: 0,2 }}/2021-03-19-recessed-box-to-seal-coswall-85mm.md %})

## So what are its advantages:

1. It has a side dimension of 86mm which makes it compatible with square flush-mounting boxes, moreover, there are very good ones on Aliexpress link above:
2. Exists in European and US version
3. Available in 3 colors (white/black/gold)
4. Available in 1,2 and 3 keys (gang)
5. Touch interface is responsive and responsive, we encountered no issues during testing
6. The switch incorporates **the neutral (connection not compulsory)** <span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">*does better than the competition*.</span>
7. acts as a zigbee network relay (if the neutral is connected).
8. By plugging in **the phase only the blue LED lights up** without the need to **add a capacitance** <span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">*does better than the competition*.</span>
9. the **blue light is discreet**, so it can easily be used in a bedroom
10. **No contactor noise** when changing state.
11. It works in **Toggle mode** (so no need to plug in a light bulb)
12. As a result, we can simulate a back and forth (2way) via our favorite assistant.
13. The more than attractive price 15-17€ for the white inter 1 touch

## What's the downside as I found only one other than it doesn't act as a router when the neutral isn't connected

1. **The internal antenna lacks power** during our tests the switch is located 3 meters from the zigbee antenna and the **LQI indicated 52**, while the xiaomi door sensor located at the same distance **displays 113 LQI**. Having tested several touchscreens of different brands, the results remain essentially the same.
2. The switch light does not work in Toggle mode (without bulbs connected through the switch).

## In conclusion

Do not hesitate, you can go for it and buy it, it is really a very good product.
