More than a beep beep
Always imagine having a friend who tells you when something is wrong with you. Someone alerts you instantly when smoke is detected. Beep…Beep…Beeeeeep. A friend with great volume - and who is a strong guy. Someone who also alerts you when you're away from home, where even the loudest smoke alarms will have to give up.

A pocket protector
Zigbee-based smoke detector helps protect your home from fires, wherever you are. It notifies you with a loud sound when it detects smoke or fire, and it has the added feature of alerting you remotely via notifications. This way you can call the fire department or ask a neighbor to check your house if you are not home. Perfect if you travel a lot, have a second home, or just want to feel more secure. The smart smoke detector is battery powered and easy to install.

A true friend you can trust
The smart smoke detector connects to other smoke detectors. Not all heroes wear capes.
