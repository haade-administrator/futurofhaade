SONOFF ZBMINI is a ZigBee-enabled two-way smart switch that is compatible with various zigbee coordinators, including SONOFF ZBBridge, Amazon Hub, Samsung SmartThings Hub and Philips Hue Hub. The ZigBee3.0 protocol makes it possible to quickly pair ZBMINI and ZigBee bridge. ZBMINI is safer to use in your home which is promised by the fireproof shell. Additionally, encryption at AES-128 ensures that security is extended to the privacy of the data device, without worrying about your device's privacy being exposed. It can be used as a **Zigbee router** to help transmit the ZigBee signal to ensure a stable connection when multiple Zigbee devices are used for your home. If you are passionate about bi-directional control, you can connect a Single-pole Double-Throw switch as an external connection to expand the control mode.

**Incompatible with**

- push button switches called rocker
