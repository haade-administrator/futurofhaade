Argon had already released a first aluminum raspberry pi box at a very affordable price, now they are going further by offering a variant with a hard disk, more data loss on sdcard, ** that's really the good news of the moment! **

**Advantage of Argon One + Nvme M.2 Disk**

1. Box of very good quality and sold complete
2. Sold complete without power supply
3. well made circuit board
4. possibility to buy the hard disk directly 128GB
5. ventilated
6. hatch for access to the GPIO
