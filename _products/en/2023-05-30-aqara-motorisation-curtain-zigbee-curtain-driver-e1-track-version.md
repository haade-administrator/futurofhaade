Simply hang a curtain operator on the track and start enjoying automated control of your existing curtains based on weather, time or other triggered Aqara devices.

## Up to 1 year battery life
Power-saving technologies and a huge 6400mAh battery make the Curtain Driver E1 the longest-lasting controller of its type. You can forget to charge it for a year.

## Zigbee 3.0 Protocol
Enjoy the benefits of the fastest, most stable and energy efficient home automation technology. Better stability and compatibility (more standardized protocol), longer support and more features.

## Support for most popular curtain rods
The Curtain Driver E1 supports virtually all types of curtain rods. The Rod version supports all types, while a more economical Track version only supports U- and I-track.

## Built-in light sensor
The integrated light sensor allows the Curtain Driver E1 to be automatically controlled according to the actual brightness: if it is too bright outside, the curtains will open on their own and vice versa!

## Maximum load of 12 kg
The Curtain Driver E1 can pull even the heaviest curtains: thanks to its powerful motor, the maximum load can reach a record 12 kilograms!

## Easy install
Installation is very quick and requires no additional tools: the Curtain Driver can simply be mounted on existing curtain rails.

## USB-C for charging or power supply
The most modern and versatile Type-C port is used to constantly charge or even power the device. (Note: constant power supply requires the cable to be placed freely to prevent it from becoming entangled).

## One button remote control
With the Aqara Home app, full operation of your curtain can be done with the push of a single button, like the Aqara Mini Switch. Alternatively, the Aqara Cube T1 Pro can be used to adjust the aperture level by turning.

## HomeKit and support for other ecosystems
Compatible with the most popular ecosystems and can be controlled by voice. HomeKit, Alexa, Google, IFTTT, Alice, Marusya are supported.

## Support for device grouping
You can choose between one or two Curtain Driver per window. In the event of a two-person installation, they can be grouped together so that they open the curtains simultaneously!

## Intelligent automation based on time, weather, etc.
Connect the device to the Aqara Home app and you can forget about operating the device manually: after setting up automations, it will be controlled by time, weather or other Aqara devices!

## Adjustable opening speed
The motor speed can be adjusted, so it will work quieter and open the curtain slowly to make your wake up more comfortable.

**Note: This model only supports U and I type rails.**{: .red }
