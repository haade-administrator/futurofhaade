Fibaro Wall Plug, the smallest Z-Wave+ plug module in the world!

The Fibaro Wall Plug is an intelligent and extremely compact plug module, which allows you to control lighting or any other device via Z-Wave commands. It is designed to work with any type of load with a maximum power of 2500W.

The Fibaro Wall Plug has the power consumption measurement function. Thus, the instantaneous consumption and total consumption values are sent to the Z-Wave controller. A visual indicator also allows you to see an overview of consumption at a glance: a green ring indicates low consumption while a red ring indicates very high consumption.

This module also offers a unique function: the possibility of testing the Z-Wave network coverage. All you have to do is press the module button for a few seconds, the light purple LED informs you that the network is in test mode and allows you to see the current coverage by the color displayed.

**Although it has a German plug (Schuko), this module can be used in France.**{: .red}
