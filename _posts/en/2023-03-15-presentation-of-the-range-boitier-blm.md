Here is a short article, concerning the integration of modules behind sockets or switches. As very often we are equipped with recessed boxes 4cm deep. Between electrical wire and the thickness of products already in place, does it quickly become tricky to easily integrate an additional home automation module?

> Fortunately BLM is here! and thanks to [Domadoo](https://www.domadoo.fr/fr/?domid=39){: target="_blank"} for providing me with this module to test.

# Presentation

A few photos taken on the fly, you will realize that this case has a large pocket.

BLM has created a hermetic module in order to comply with the RT2012 standard, with mounting at two angles at 45 or 90 degrees. The size of the pocket makes it easy to put the bulkiest modules, ideal for integrating at the same time more lengths of electrical wires and **why not an additional temperature sensor**.

# Layout diagram

Thanks to this BLM recessed box, you can easily place micromodules behind an existing switch to make the installation invisible. The pocket is a real asset since it will save you from the difficulties of installing the micromodule. This product has flexible cable/tube entries providing excellent airtightness, thus increasing the building's passive energy efficiency.
