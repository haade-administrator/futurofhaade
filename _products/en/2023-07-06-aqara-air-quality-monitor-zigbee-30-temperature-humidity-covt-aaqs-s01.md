The Aqara AAQS-S01 Air Quality Monitor can detect the concentration and level of TVOC in the air, as well as temperature and humidity. Once linked to a hub, it can use TVOC, temperature and humidity concentration or level changes as automation conditions, work with other smart home devices to implement various smart scenarios and send notifications to your mobile phone.

What are VOCs and where do they come from?
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a large and diverse group of compounds that volatilize into air at room temperature. Inside your home, volatile organic compounds are harmful, carcinogenic air pollutants that evaporate under normal indoor atmospheric conditions.

The majority of industrial VOCs come from everyday household commodities, such as sprays and aerosols like air fresheners, cleaners and pesticides. Many products, such as glue, new furniture and carpets, building materials and electronic devices also produce VOCs through outgassing. Your home will emit these trapped VOCs and could harm you and your family.

Triple sensors for multi-dimensional detection
Aqara AAQS-S01 air quality monitor has three built-in sensors which are developed through advanced electrochemical and semiconductor technology solutions to ensure stability and accuracy. The temperature and humidity compensation algorithm can effectively reduce the influence of environmental changes, and the reading resolution can be fine-tuned to 0.01mg/m3.

**Note: This device is an EU version and is intended for use with the EU version of an Aqara EU Hub. In addition, a recent update made by the manufacturer makes this product unusable with Jeedom (firmware version ending in 27 and above). **{: .red}
