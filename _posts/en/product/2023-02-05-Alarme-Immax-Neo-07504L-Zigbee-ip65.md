A security alarm or simply a siren will protect your property at home, in a cottage or in a garage. Its basic location is to use it as a house alarm, but you can choose any space for the location. As standard, the siren is powered by a mains adapter and is also equipped with an integrated battery. The siren will therefore work even if it is disconnected from the electrical source by the intruder. The siren has a volume of up to 95dB**, so you can rely on sound even in a very crowded room.
