A first for Haade, I'm going to present to you a **connected lock** made in Eastern countries, **the Tedee Go** with the **Tedee bridge** which goes well and finally, the ** Tedee** digicode. For the record, I asked Tedee to provide me with the **Pro version** which looks more attractive, **but soon it will not be offered for sale to the general public**.

{% include product-embed.html guid="2193" %}

> I find it a shame because **despite the high price**, it has a rechargeable battery which has a longer battery life!

**Thank you to the Tedee company** for providing me with a good part of the range in order to be able to carry out the tests in good conditions!

The complete Tedee Range is [available from our partner **domadoo!**](https://www.domadoo.fr/en/380_tedee?domid=39){: target="_blank"}

## The lock {{ page.ref }}

### Unboxing

We are not going to dwell on the subject because you will easily find all the information on the net. The tedee go module is well packaged and you will find:

- a lock connected with batteries
- a cylinder support not exceeding 3mm at the outlet
- a cleaning wipe
- an allen key
- the notice
- the cardboard guide with QRcode

**Against competition**

In terms of dimensions (from the front), I would like to point out, **Tedee Go is very small**, if you are ready to put your hand in your wallet, the Tedee Pro is even smaller. Big positive point for the brand. However, the depth is quite significant *which still offers a good grip.*

{% picture posts/{{ page.guid }}/comparatif-dimension-serrure-connecte-du-marche.png --alt comparison of the size of the tedee go lock versus the competition--img width="940" height="267" %}

### Installation and Advantage

Well you will find all the information on the web and on the future video which will be released soon [on our Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcXJ1ZsjEvQxuWJy7gH-A6w){: target="_blank"}.

> It installs very quickly and effortlessly, I guarantee it 👍

{% include videoPlayer.html externalId="https://tedee.com/app/uploads/2023/06/Tedee-GO-Installation-guide-with-and-without-adapter-1-3.mp4?_=1" %}

1. **Keep your current hardware:** You will install the Tedee GO in a few minutes, on the current cylinder, **without having to replace the hardware, and all without making a single hole.**
2. **Keeps the keys:** Tedee GO is a key turner, **you don't have to replace the key or twist it**, the Tedee GO lock fits onto the key. You can of course open from the outside with your traditional key.
3. **Virtual keys:** Share access to the home with family, friends or tenants. Facilitates access with virtual keys in the Tedee app, controlling who enters, when, for how long and at what time.
4. **Your personal doorman:** Relax with simple features – set Tedee GO to automatically lock when you leave or return home.

### lock options {{ page.ref }} with the app

1. Automatically lock the door when the lock is unlocked
2. Automatically lock the door when the lock is semi-locked
3. automatic unlocking when you are near the door (bluetooth)
4. Latch (without exterior handle chosen to open the door entirely)
5. configure the physical button of the lock (unlock/lock, automatic closing with delay, time delay)
6. Calibration
7. Alert on unlocked lock
8. Emergency unlock option

{% picture posts/{{ page.guid }}/option-appli-tedee-go-verrouillage-loquet.png --alt tedee go lock, unlock and latch option --img width="940" height="509" %}

I repeat throughout this thread, this lock **is a delight** in terms of installation and installation. **Tedee signs it flawlessly**. If you are looking for a lock without tinkering and without having done the science to configure it then **the Tedee Go is made for you** 👍.

{% picture posts/{{ page.guid }}/option-appli-tedee-go-bouton-urgence-alerte.png --alt tedee go option button settings, emergency option and alert notification --img width="940" height="509" %}

### Quality of the {{ page.ref }}

The system protection handle is tinted an aluminum gray, **but I'm a little disappointed** because it's not, **it's definitely ABS plastic**, probably a choice made by the company and certainly because of the weight of the whole thing.

{% picture posts/{{ page.guid }}/qualite-coque-plastique-tedee-go.png --alt quality of the tedee Go shell in ABS not the best --img width="940" height="529" %}

### The noise in all this 💩

So I looked a little on the web, there are videos where you can hear this lock in operation, but no one really talks about it, yet this lock is noisy.

> If like me **you have teenagers at home**, the lock will trigger eczema in you! ...

The video was taken about 60cm from the lock with the smartphone, the decibels rise to 70, **marcel heats up...**

{% include videoPlayer.html youtubeId="8JQ87AqHA74?si=jta7TXpiGcscEfBU" %}

{% include product-embed.html guid="2194" %}

### Battery consumption

The module works with 3 CR123 batteries, these are lithium batteries which are relatively **expensive**. You find them on the internet between 2 and 4€ depending on the quality/brand.
I am at **5 days of operation**, the autonomy drops by 1% per day with the original batteries, **I have 95% left**
The manufacturer gives a lifespan of **6 to 8 months** for an average of 8 operations per day or 4 openings/closings.

Apart from the first day I am below 8 at a rate of 1% per day, we would have 100 days of autonomy or 3 months and a week.

> If you do seasonal rentals, you better change them at the end of May to hope that they last until September!

**Product advantages:**{: .blue}
- The application (difficult to do better)
- installation (super practical)
- Bluetooth connectivity
- manufacturing quality

**The - of the product:**{: .red}
- Battery module 3 x CR123
- energy consuming
- plastic handle
- very noisy
- Bridge required to connect it to external home automation
- the price 165€

## Tedee Bridge for {{ page.ref }}

{% include product-embed.html guid="2195" %}

The Tedee Bridge wireless router allows you to control the Tedee GO connected lock via the Internet, and allows you to benefit from the API in order to easily control it via a home automation box, in my case Home-Assistant. **Is it necessary! Personally, if you are interested in home automation then buy the Tedee bridge.**

**The Bridge is well made**, nothing to say about the packaging and design. As you may have noticed, **there is no thread**, but you could add one. Originally you fit the bridge onto the socket and plug it in. Then you start the app and follow the guide, 2 minutes later the bridge will take over **the tedee Go lock** and it's f.i.n.i.s.h.e.d.

{% picture posts/{{ page.guid }}/deballage-module-bridge-pour-serrure-connectee-tedee.png --alt Presentation and unpacking of the bridge to open access to the outside of the tedee go --img width="940" height="529" %}

Well you know **having a connected lock is good**, using it with an application that is 100% functional is better, but if you are like me and you use several brands or protocols, centralize all in a single application, it's still a great comfort.

**For the record**, one day a mechanic came to my house to change the tires on the car, anyway, he started talking about his solar system, and the control, so I veered off on home automation, logic. And then he begins to take out the laptop and show me various applications to control everything he has automated.

> And I said to myself, how does he manage to get out of this, it's the smartphone that must be heating up!

**The - of the product:**{: .red}
- the price (79€)

> After Tedee Go, **the bridge is a treat** in terms of installation and configuration in the Tedee application. You will appreciate this simplicity!

## Tedee Keypad passcode

{% include product-embed.html guid="2196" %}

> Certainly this keyboard is not cheap, **99€** just the price leaves one wondering, but we continue on a good path

{% picture posts/{{ page.guid }}/deballage-digicode-pour-serrure-connectee-tedee-go.png --alt contents of the Tedee Go digital code box --img width="940" height="529" %}

But frankly **it remains an interesting discovery**, of remarkable quality, it does what we ask of it, *with integration into the application as simple as Tedee Go and Bridge*. It works via Bluetooth so it must be at a certain maximum distance from the {{ page.ref }} for reasons of coverage and security. The product is very well made with thick plastics and molded on the back.

### Operation details

{% picture posts/{{ page.guid }}/détail-des-fonctions-du-digicode-tedee.png --alt detailed operation of the Tedee Go digital code keys --img width="940" height="346" %}

- Unlock the door without a smartphone using a PIN code
- Installation in just a few minutes, powered by 3 VARTA AAA batteries. Installation with glue or screws, even outdoors.
- Choose a 5 to 8 digit code and define, modify and assign PIN codes **via the mobile app wherever you are**
- Manages up to 100 active PIN codes and assigns unique codes to users for complete control of access and activity history.
- Finally Share access simply by giving the logical PIN code! NO !.

**No risk taken**

No data is stored in the keyboard. It only connects to the tedee connected lock which operates via a secure cloud.

### Tedee digital code option

{% picture posts/{{ page.guid }}/gestion-code-acces-tedee-avec-appli.png --alt Access to tedee digicode options on the official application --img width="940" height="509" %}

The Tedee digital code is not left out in terms of options, you can configure:

- the sound
- the backlight
- activate a doorbell button notification
- locking without pin code

{% picture posts/{{ page.guid }}/gestion-code-acces-tedee-avec-appli-option-digicode.png --alt Lots of options for the Tedee digital code, sounds, backlights, notifications --img width="940" height="509" %}

As I said, the products in the Tedee range are very well made, the application is full of configurable options and that's a real plus.

**So know if this Digicode is useful to you?**

Yes, if people (children, seasonal tenants) must have the key and do not have a telephone or do not want to install the Tedee application.

## Tedee product instructions

{% include doclink.html pdf="installation-utilisation-user-guide-tedee-go-EN.pdf" title="Tedee Go installation instructions and user manual" %}

{% include doclink.html pdf="installation-user-guide-bridge-tedee-EN.pdf" title="Tedee Bridge installation instructions and user manual" %}

## The Tedee application

Google playstore: [Tedee](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tedee.mobile&hl=fr&gl=US)

Apple AppStore: [Tedee](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/tedee/id1481874162)

I'm not a fan of home automation through multiple applications, **but rather for all in one** that's why systems like **Jeedom** or **Home-assistant** exist, fortunately there are these solutions, but for the moment they are not as complete as the Tedee application, You will still be able to control the lock!

**The Tedee application is very well done**, integrating the brand's products only takes a few seconds and configuration is simplified. everything happens via QRCode and a Bluetooth connection apart from the bridge where a wifi setting is necessary (2.4 and 5Ghz compatible), here too I encountered no problems. As soon as your module is recognized, the application already offers an update which only takes a few seconds and all transferred by Bluetooth.

> frankly I have rarely seen an **application that is so optimized** and easy to use.

### Tedee pairing

The Tedee modules (Go, Bridge and digicode) are equipped with **Bluetooth** as well as qrcodes on the product and on the instructions **for pairing**, only the digicode does not have a qrcode on the product. oblique safety guard. At the request of the app scan the qrcode of the new product and it will be integrated immediately, **if an update is available it will be done directly at lightning speed.** ⚡

### Guest Access Sharing

The application is well designed to generate access with various settings as well as **sending automatic emails**, but *I am disappointed* because the person **must download the app** to be able to use this access, a link in the form of buttons to click would have been simpler *because if you do seasonal rental the customer may be reluctant to install this type of app.* *Well there is still the Tedee Digicode which will lighten your workload a little more. wallet*.

{% include product-embed.html guid="2194" %}

## Tedee Compatibility

### Tedee API

An API in constant evolution [available here](https://api.tedee.com/swagger/index.html#/)

{% picture posts/{{ page.guid }}/parametres-bridge-app-tedee-go-et-acces-api.png --alt Access to the API on the app to configure Tedee Go and external source software as a home assistant --img width="940" height="509" %}

The [brand shows compatibility](https://tedee.com/smart-home-integrations/){: target="_blank"} with Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit or Homey but also Fibaro, eedomus, Loxone, neuronhouse, Jeedom, Ampio and **Home-Assistant**

> In all these cases you will need the Tedee Bridge

### with bridge
- Home assistant
- Jeedom (plugin €4)
- Fibaro
- Eedomus
- Loxone
- etc...

## Home Assistant integration

And yes the {{ page.ref }} lock is partially compatible with home assistant but to do so you will ideally need the bridge but not obligatory, you could use the {{ page.ref }} directly with HA through ** of homekit if you already have a homekit bridge** but you will not have access to all the functions.

### With the Tedee bridge

Once the bridge is configured via the official Tedee application, go to the settings and activate the API. Once activated, go to the API information and retrieve the Token key as well as the IP address, [see the screenshot above](#tedee-api)

Then the rest happens in Home-Assistant in a way that is more than a simple click directly on the button below

{% include homeassistantlink.html integration_brand="tedee" %}

Enter the IP address as well as the token and you will have directly all the information which will come up in Home Assistant (for the moment only the lock and the bridge will come up), I don't have too much concern for the integration of the others components because the API is very complete. You can also participate in the integration project because there is a [python library](https://pypi.org/project/pytedee-async/){: target="_blank"} integration and the corresponding [github](https://github.com/zweckj/pytedee_async){: target="_blank"}

### Rendering home-assistant and {{ page.ref }}

{% picture posts/{{ page.guid }}/integration-bridget-et-tedee-go-home-assistant.png --alt integration tedee go and bridge in home assistant --img width="940" height="113" %}

On the Tedee application I have a bridge, a Tedee Go and a Digicode installed, and currently only the Bridge and the Tedee Go are recognized. The Bridge does not include functions to control.
For the {{ page.ref }} lock, you will find the main locking function as well as information that I was unable to reconcile with the Tedee application.

- Like the duration of the mechanism at 2 (which should be an opening delay)
- Mechanism activated...
- semi-locked (well this is the option on the app).

{% picture posts/{{ page.guid }}/fonctions-disponibles-tedee-go-home-assistant.png --alt functions available in home assistant of the tedee go connected lock --img width="940" height="623" %}

Below I made an **Animated Gif** of how unlocking works and all without going through the Tedee cloud (because we use the API call). **The operation under Home Assistant of the {{ page.ref }} is super interesting.**

Because you can choose between unlocking the handle **or** unlocking with action on the latch, **unlike the Tedee app** or you must select a latch option beforehand before you can use it.

{% include product-embed.html guid="2193" %}

## Conclusion

**The Tedee Go lock, the Tedee Bridge and the Digicode are successful installations and integrations into the world of the Tedee brand.** The whole thing is manufactured in Europe (Poland) and it is a good thing.

The Tedee Go connected lock is a **good lock** but has **2** **negative** points, one **it is noisy** and two it is **energy-consuming**.

> If noise is the least of your worries then I recommend Tedee Go smart lock, otherwise pass your turn.
