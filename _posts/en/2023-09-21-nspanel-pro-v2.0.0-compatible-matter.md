## New updates:

1. **Support as a Matter hub** to add Matter-enabled devices to the eWeLink app. Currently supports switches and sockets.
2. Support **Bluetooth connection** of external devices **such as speakers** and play music or alarm through external speakers.
3. Support sync Philips Hue lights **from eWeLink app**.
4. **ZBMINI-L and ZBMINIL2** can be selected as **thermostat execution** devices.


## Optimization:

1. **Optimization of thermostat function.** Improved accuracy of temperature control, good news the minimum adjustable unit is 0.5, added “+” and “-” buttons; optimized thermostat interface.

> Some new features require the APP to be upgraded to V 5.0 before they can be used.

## Conclusion

This article is presented as a version announcement, I have not tested it to see if this firmware **supports matter and zigbee at the same time** and this without automatically going through ewelink. I will have to look into the subject and soon I will do a test with the new Sonoff MINIR4M mini relay which was lent to me a short time ago by the company Itead.
