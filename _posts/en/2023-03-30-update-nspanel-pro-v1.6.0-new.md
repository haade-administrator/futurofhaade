Itead has promised us regular updates and it is the case, let's take stock of what's new in **version 1.6.0** of the NSPanel pro command module.

To begin with, if you haven't read my previous article on the NSPanel pro, I'll [put the link here]({% post_url /en/2023-03-10-unboxing-test-and-installation-sonoff-nspanel-pro %}), **it may be able to meet some of your expectations!**

*Seen a previous article* the next version was to integrate the **support for the Matter protocol**, you will realize that this is not the case yet, and that does not surprise me because for the moment I know that the **EFR32MG21 chip supports either the Zigbee protocol or the Matter protocol**. But not both at the same time as advertised by many programs. I am curious to know and both **skeptical about the support of the two protocols side by side**, indeed as written in a previous article, currently only the chip **EFR32MG24** from silicon labs is able to make these protocols work together.

**Reminder:** The NSPanel Pro smart home control panel integrates all your devices and scenes for central control. On this panel, you can view camera monitoring, adjust light color temperature, room temperature, light colors, turn lights on/off, etc. Its version update log and FAQ are as follows.

# What's new in version 1.6.0

1. Zigbee sub-devices support timer function, and some Zigbee devices support OTA
2. Support S31, POWR3, POW Elite, POW Origin, TH Elite, TH Origin as runtime device in thermostat
3. The thermostat can be set as an executive action in a smart scene, including turning on/off the thermostat, switching to manual/automatic mode

**Optimization:**

1. Optimize the connection steps, you can access the Wi-Fi settings on the scan code page
2. Change Boot Animation

# Conclusion

For the moment it is a minor version whose improvements are minimal and unfortunately focused on only Sonoff products.
