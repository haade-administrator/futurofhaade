**MINIR4M is SONOFF's first Matter device**, it can recognize and work with other brands of Matter end devices, and integrate with Matter compatible platforms, such as Apple Home, Google Home, Alexa, etc. Controlling all smart devices through a single app is no longer a fantasy. Matter certified devices support local communication in the home network, even if the network is disconnected, MINIR4M still works normally, with faster responsiveness and better reliability. Adding MINIR4M to Matter-enabled apps is simple. Simply scan the Matter QR code that comes with your Matter-enabled app and MINIR4M is easily set up by following the steps in the app.

**MINIR4M is equipped with ESP32 chip**, its small size fits various mounting boxes, including type 86/EU, type 120 mounting box. MINIR4M supports external switch control and easily connects to momentary switch, door exit switch, SPDT switch, interlock switch and even dry contact sensors.

**MINIR4M features a "detached relay" mode**, which means that the states of the external switches and the relay are separated, so actuation of the external switch button will not affect the state of the relay. For example, if you open the "detach relay" mode, when you turn off the light, your smart light will not be offline and you can still use the app to control the smart lights.
