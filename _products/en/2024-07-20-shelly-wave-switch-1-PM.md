Monitor and measure the power consumption of a wide range of household appliances and office equipment (lights, power lines, security systems, heaters, water heaters, etc.) from anywhere.

### Shelly Qubino works with Z-Wave

Using Z-Wave, smart home products can communicate with each other seamlessly, regardless of brand or platform, through a centralized smart hub! Shelly Qubino devices run on the latest generation of Z-Wave chips (S800), one of the most popular standardized technologies for smart homes in the world.

### Works with any Z-Wave gateway

Wave 1PM is retrofit and designed to fit behind any switch or outlet, instantly transforming it into a smart switch. Once installed, include it in your Z-Wave network (Z-Wave gateway required) and control connected devices from anywhere using your smartphone or tablet. Shelly Qubino devices work with over 4000 Z-Wave certified devices and gateways.

### Associations

Establish direct communication between devices on your local Z-Wave network and set custom actions without a hub!

### Consumption measurement

Wave 1PM provides accurate monitoring of energy consumption.

### Wide supply voltage range

Use a wide range of output voltage levels. Supports low voltages.

### Smart schedules

Create custom schedules that align with your daily routine or synchronize with sunrise/sunset to manage your lighting (gateway required).

### Smart Scenes

Set custom scenes by combining Wave 1PM with any other Z-wave device (gateway required).
