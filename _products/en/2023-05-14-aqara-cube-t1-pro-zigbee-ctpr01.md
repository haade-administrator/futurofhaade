The Cube T1 Pro has incorporated all the benefits of the iconic Cube Controller while being even easier to use. No more memorizing all 7 actions: now you can use each side to control different scenes or devices.

## Zigbee 3.0 Protocol
Enjoy the benefits of the fastest, most stable and energy-efficient smart home technology. Better stability and compatibility (more standardized protocol), longer support and more features.

## Wide Compatibility
Thanks to the new Scene mode, the Cube T1 Pro can now be used as a HomeKit controller and will support Matter after the official publication of the standard. Apart from that, it also supports Alexa, IFTTT and other ecosystems.

## More Scene Mode Actions
Now you can use each side to control different scenes or devices. Each of the sides has clear dice-shaped indicators that will clearly indicate which side is controlling which device.

## Classic Cube Action Mode
Alternatively, you can switch the T1 Pro to Action mode, which will make it act the same as the classic Cube Controller while retaining other benefits such as Zigbee 3.0.

## Up to 2 years battery life
In addition to making the product more environmentally friendly, the ultra-low power consumption will allow you to forget about changing batteries for years.

## Turn to control
You can adjust the brightness or temperature of other Aqara luminaires or the percentage of opening of the curtain by rotating the cube: everything is configurable in the Aqara Home application.

## Sustainability via OTA
The Cube now supports OTA updates, which means new features and fixes can be added after the product is released.
