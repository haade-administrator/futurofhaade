description: "Bluetooth is a telecommunications standard allowing bidirectional exchange of data over short distances using UHF radio waves in a frequency band between 2.402Ghz and 2.480GHz. Its goal is to simplify connections between nearby electronic devices by eliminating wired connections. It can replace, for example, cables between computers, tablets, speakers, mobile phones with each other or with printers, scanners, keyboards, mice, video game controllers, mobile phones, personal assistants, hands-free systems for microphones or headphones , car radios, digital cameras, barcode readers and interactive advertising terminals."
