**Haade is a blog for home automation** and IT enthusiasts. The site aims to **distribute simple and effective tutorials with a minimum of advertising** so as not to scare away readers.

This year was an important turning point for the blog. With a new site interface, completely redesigned and hosted on GitHub, making it very fast. Also I was able to enter into new collaborations with the companies **(Domadoo, Itead)** which provide me with all the desired products. **Finally, my goal is to develop the site and publish around a hundred articles per year.**

For the moment Haade is nothing more than a non-profit website, however I would like to develop this aspect and create a business. In addition, in the long term, I would like to create new niche products that still do not exist in the world of home automation. **If you want to be part of the adventure don't hesitate**ðŸ‘Œ.

**New:** At the end of the year we are going to develop the vlog section by adding content to our YouTube page. A new Polo collaborator will join me to feed these videos.

> **I am currently the main editor of the blog and therefore I am looking for new collaborators!**

If you're interested, your task will be to write new articles in the form of tutorials where you can contribute your experience. In order to have a small return on investment **you can incorporate your own advertising links** (in the form of a product block), as is already the case on the site. If you don't have a partnership we can probably find a solution together. **In addition, I can provide you with the modules of your choice (available on Domadoo or Itead)** in order to be able to create Product test articles, see the [product testing page](../category/tests){: target="_blank"}

**Sought collaborators:**
- users of Jeedom, Home-Assistant, Openhab ...
- Forum manager (github)
- knowledge of Github (preferable)
- knowledge of markdown (preferable)
- knowledge of **home automation**
- knowledge of electronics
- knowledge of embedded media (NAS, etc.)
- knowledge of **VLOG** (preferably)
- be part of a community adventure

***In short, you will have understood that if you are motivated and want to develop the blog alongside me, you are welcome.***

**To contact me you can via:**
- the [contact form](../contact/){: target="_blank"}
- by leaving a comment on the page
- by email: **administrator[@]haade.fr**
