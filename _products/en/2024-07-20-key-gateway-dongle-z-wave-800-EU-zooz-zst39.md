### Add Z-Wave Technology Easily!

Instantly connect to thousands of certified Z-Wave devices with this simple USB radio dongle. It’s a great way to explore the capabilities of Z-Wave.

Whether you’re building your own home automation system or collecting wireless sensor data for research, this device lets you quickly add Z-Wave to your system. It’s equipped with the latest 800-series chipset and is ready for long-range Z-Wave if your software supports it.

Get the most out of your automation system with S2 Authenticated Security and SmartStart features that provide a layer of protection to your system like no other wireless technology.

### How does it work?

You’ll need home automation software and a computer to host it. Once you plug the 800 key into a standard USB port on your PC, Mac or Raspberry Pi, your smart home will start speaking Z-Wave - the most popular language for home automation devices.

You will be able to control, monitor and program scenes or rules for over 200 Z-Wave devices within a single network. All of this will work locally unless you decide to move your smart home to the cloud to add remote access.

The 800 key will work out of the box with the most popular operating systems. It is compatible with your favorite software like Home Assistant or Jeedom.
