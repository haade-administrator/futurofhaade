Z-Wave Smart Switch, 1-Gang 8A with Power Metering
Designed for convenience, this mini switch offers all the capabilities of the Wave 1PM in a compact, space-saving form factor. At 35% smaller than the Wave 1PM, the Wave 1PM Mini is perfect for tight spaces where traditional modules simply won’t fit. Despite their small size, Wave Mini devices don’t compromise on performance or functionality.
