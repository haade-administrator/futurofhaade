description: "Discovering the roots of Tedee leads us to a narrative that intertwines the past with the present. The brand name ‘Tedee’ is a contemporary nod to the ingenuity of Theodorus of Samos, an illustrious inventor from ancient Greece known for his significant contributions to craftsmanship and technology. Theodorus’s creations, especially the concept of the key, revolutionized security in his time.
 
The founders, inspired by the innovative spirit of Theodorus, saw a reflection of his pioneering ethos in their state-of-the-art smart lock technology. In naming their company ‘Tedee’, they sought to encapsulate the essence of Theodorus’s legacy in a name that would resonate through the ages. It was a deliberate choice, connecting the dots from ancient history to a modern brand, symbolizing a lineage of security and innovation.
 
The name ‘Tedee’ is thus more than a label; it’s a tribute. It represents a bridge from the wisdom of ancient Greek innovation to the forefront of today’s smart home technology. Each Tedee smart lock is a testament to the company’s origin story—a story that pays homage to Theodorus’s legendary status as a protector of what is valuable. This clear lineage from Theodorus to ‘Tedee’ defines the brand’s identity: a fusion of historical inspiration and contemporary innovation."
