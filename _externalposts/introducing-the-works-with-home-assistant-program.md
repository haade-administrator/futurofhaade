description: " With Home Assistant, we integrate with over 1000 different APIs. The majority of these integrations are created and maintained by the Home Assistant community. Over the years a number of companies have stepped up to work with our community offering samples and engineering support. In a few cases, we saw companies pick up the maintenance of integrating their products in Home Assistant. 
 Sadly, a couple of times it happened that companies went silent after their initial contribution, causing users to be wondering why new devices are not being supported. We want to protect our users from investing in products for their homes that won���t work well with Home Assistant. 
 Today we���re introducing the Works with Home Assistant program to allow manufacturers to show their support and commitment to Home Assistant and its community. 
 The program requires manufacturers to maintain the integration of their products in Home Assistant, offer a good user experience, provide product samples and give us an engineering contact to escalate issues. In return, manufacturers will be able to use the ���Works with Home Assistant��� badge on their products and documentation. The terms of the Works with Home Assistant program are enforced in an agreement signed by both Nabu Casa and the manufacturer. 

  
 With Home Assistant we are always working on educating our users about preferring local control and open standards when acquiring new products. This is also reflected in the ���Works with Home Assistant��� badges. 
 There are manufacturers that are creating products that integrate into Home Assistant using standards like Z-Wave, Zigbee, or Matter (soon). In these cases, the integration is maintained by the Home Assistant community and Nabu Casa. These companies can still become a member of the Works with Home Assistant program but are relieved from integration maintenance. 
 Products that are approved for the Made with ESPHome program will be eligible to use the ���Works locally with Home Assistant��� badge as part of their Made with ESPHome membership. 
 For more information for manufacturers, see our Works with Home Assistant portal.
