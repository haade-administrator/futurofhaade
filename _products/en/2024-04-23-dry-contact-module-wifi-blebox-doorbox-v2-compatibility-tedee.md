**Replace your remote controls**, cards or keys with your cell phone. Make your lock relays connected with the Tedee Relay Module and experience the total freedom and ease of keyless living.

**At your home**
Never search for your keys, remotes or badges again. Make your return home an easier and hassle-free experience. No more manually unlocking gates and garage doors. Now you can relax and unlock them all in the Tedee app. The relay module works in private homes and shared properties such as residential buildings, condominiums or subdivisions.

**In your company **
Do you want to consolidate your company's access management in one place? – even on multiple sites, using different types of equipment and with an unlimited number of employees? Integrating your lock relays with Tedee Web Portal or Blebox makes administration of all access points easy, affordable and wireless for your business. Individual employee accounts allow for detailed activity logs, and their access can be easily modified or revoked.

**At your rental**
Relax as a host. Give your guests the freedom and flexibility to enter and exit the property as they please, under your control. Host your guests completely keyless and stay in control with your app's connected security features. Allow all common doors – from the street to the apartment – to be unlocked using a smartphone app or links. Seamlessly associate the relay module with the Tedee connected lock, Bridge and keyboard for automatic connected hosting.

**Under your control**
Add modern connected features even to older, analog devices. The Tedee Relay Module is an instant upgrade that provides online control of existing home devices. Never waste time exchanging keys or PINs again. Instead, you can share your Relay module's virtual keys with family, employees, or maintenance workers without compromising security. Allow other people to unlock devices with their smartphone or links, with the permissions you set in your app. Limit their access by selecting the dates and times you want access to the Tedee relay module to be active. Choose to make it permanent, temporary or recurring, daily or weekly, for example, every morning or only on Thursdays. Managing security and privacy is easy with our Tedee mobile app or Web Portal. You can view the activity logs of your devices, control them remotely or share access.
