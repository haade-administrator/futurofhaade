description: "Matter to address the issue of interoperability.
Matter is a new protocol whose initial goal is to respond to a major problem in the connected home world: interoperability. Indeed, the first will of Matter is to be the universal protocol which will interconnect the whole house. Matter was born from the association of the big names in Silicon Valley dominating the voice assistant market: Amazon, Apple and Google who have joined forces to propose a common protocol on which their ecosystems will communicate. Matter does not only depend on the 3 American giants since it is more than 220 different companies which participate in the development with in particular the leaders of the sector in France such as Somfy, Schneider Electric or Legrand."
