The packaging is basic, the alarm is accompanied by a mains plug, 4 screws and dowels as well as the installation manual which can be downloaded below.

A security alarm or simply a siren will protect your property at home, in a cottage or in a garage. Its basic location is to use it as a house alarm, but you can choose any space for the location. As standard, the siren is powered by a mains adapter and is also equipped with an integrated battery. The siren will therefore work even if it is disconnected from the electrical source by the intruder. The siren has a volume of up to 95 dB, so you can rely on sound even in a very crowded room.

> For now **this alarm is only compatible with Jeedom** and the Zigbee plugin, that's I can't test the operation of the module, for those who follow me I'm on HA. However Domadoo provided me with a Jeedom Luna for testing, I will be able to do the test soon.

In the meantime I will work on this product to make it compatible with Zigbee2mqtt so it will also be usable in Homeassistant.

Below is a rendering of the dimensions of the Immax 07504L.

This alarm is interesting for its outdoor characteristics. **Indeed it is IP65**. A rubber seal is provided with which allows the internal components to be properly isolated. I advise all the same to put this comic under a porch or overhang of the roof.

Regarding the adaptation of the socket, it can easily be modified without welding because it is fixed thanks to a connector.
