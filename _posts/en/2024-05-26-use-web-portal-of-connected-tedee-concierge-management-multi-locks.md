**After a brief presentation of the Tedee GO connected lock** and integration via the Smartphone application, I suggest you deepen your knowledge through more complete data management of Tedee connected locks thanks to the cloud of the brand and management via [through the web portal](https://portal.tedee.com/){: target="_blank"}.

So why dedicate an article to this portal, simply because it offers more advanced settings than the application. Thanks to this portal, rental professionals can manage remote access to accommodation.

**Advantages of the Tedee portal**

- Data visibility
- creation of organizations such as concierge services
- creation of additional users
- associate Tedee/Blebox devices with organizations
- view the log

## Prerequisites

- The Tedee application for Smartphone
- A Tedee account created and validated
- tedee devices integrated into the application

## Dedicated articles

> To help you I have already written two test articles concerning the Tedee universe.

### Tedee Go

## Access to Tedee smart lock services

Let's get to the heart of the matter and detail the tabs of the Tedee portal, and especially why to use it

### Check the status of Tedee services

Important! whether you are an **individual**, a **accommodation professional**, if you encounter problems with remote management of connected locks Tedee, before panicking and moving or resuming your installation check **them service status** Tedee. **And yes, buying Tedee also means being dependent on the Cloud, 100% secure** 😸

And even better [sign up](https://status.tedee.com/){: target="_blank"} to be informed of developments in the services.

{% include videoPlayer.html localId="pages-status-tedee-service.mp4" localIdWm="pages-status-tedee-service.webm" %}

### Access to the Tedee Portal

Now that you know how to view the status of Tedee services, go to the portal, [nothing simpler, click here](https://portal.tedee.com/){: target="_blank"} or go to the official Tedde website and go to the footer of the main page all the links are available. Moreover, in addition to this tutorial you can find the [online Tedee portal documentation](https://tedee.com/fr/knowledge-base/portail-tedee/){: target="_blank"}

> Below is a short video which shows the connection.

{% include videoPlayer.html localId="acces-portail-tedee.mp4" %}

{%- include alert.html type="warning" text="You must use the same account on the portal as the one you created when using the Tedee app on Smartphone, Logic!" %}

## Step 1, adding an Organization

To put it simply *no creation of organizations* no configuration of Tedee devices on the portal **Apart from unlocking the lock**. *So let's not waste time and add an organization.*

{% include videoPlayer.html localId="creation-organisation.mp4" %}

**So to get back to our point**, whether you are an individual or a professional, you have connected to the portal with owner status, creating an organization will allow you to direct the settings for this organization. I assume that I am creating an organization called loc'ett which manages several accommodations.

Once created you will have access to new tabs.

## Step 2, Creating an external user

Now you can create an additional user who can have **guest** or **administrator** access basically a guest user will be able to activate the devices offered according to the settings made, while an administrator user will be able to modify the device settings access to which he was given.

{% include videoPlayer.html localId="creation-utilisateur-tedee-portail.mp4" %}

**When creating a user**, they **receive an email** asking them to download the Tedee smartphone application and create an account with the email registered in the portal. Once created, they will have access to the devices and will appear on the portal as **confirmed users.**

## Step 3, Add Devices to the organization

At this stage neither the organization nor a user can control Tedee devices. To do this you have to assign devices to the organization and you will be able to realize that the Doorbox v2 from blebox is configurable, hmm it's starting to be interesting.

{% include videoPlayer.html localId="ajouter-des-appareils-organisation-tedee.mp4" %}

## Step 4, Grant Device access by users

The organization and the user created, you will now need to give guest/administrator access to the user otherwise on the Tedee application they will not be able to activate or configure the devices.

{% include videoPlayer.html localId="accorder-acces-par-utilisateurs.mp4" %}

## Creation of usage links

**This is a very interesting tab**, why, simply because you can generate access for tenants without them needing to use a third-party application, and that's great. 

Watch the video below and you can see how the links that you could simply send by email are displayed. The end customer will just need a smartphone with internet.

{% include videoPlayer.html localId="creation-lien-utilisation-pour-locataire.mp4" %}

## (Logging) activity tracking

Another very interesting tab, especially for a main manager who will be able to monitor all activities related to Tedee devices, and you can help yourself with a search by filter (user, device, activity). The portal is really complete

{% include videoPlayer.html localId="suivi-activite-tedee-portail.mp4" %}

## Connection to an external reservation system

Finally, if you use external reservation systems like [Smoobu](https://www.smoobu.com/){: target="_blank"} or [Guesty](https://www.guesty.com/) {: target="_blank"}, well know that you can integrate these managers into Tedee and make everything interconnectable

{% include videoPlayer.html localId="connection-système-reservation-tedee-portail.mp4" %}

{% include product-embed.html guid="2193" %}

## Conclusion

I wanted to write this article to show you what Tedee is made of, to tell you that they were not content to make a product with rather successful facets, **but to make an ultra complete manager** which could even delight rental professionals.
Finally, being able to **create links** for tenants **without them having to download anything is a big plus.**

> The Tedee lock management interface is easy to use 👍
