Following the video [saving heating thanks to home automation it works]({% post_url /en/2024-03-28-saves-on-heating-thanks-to-home-automation-it-works %}), **August** returns with a comparison of thermostatic faucets [Moes ZTRV-BY-100]({% link _products/{{ page.locale | slice: 0.2 }}/2024-01-30-thermostatic-valve-moes-ztrv-by-100.md %}), [Aqara SRTS-A01]({% link _products/{{ page.locale | slice: 0.2 }}/2024-01-30-thermostatic-head-aqara-srts-a01-e1-zigbee.md %}) and [Sonoff TRVZB]({% link _products/{{ page.locale | slice: 0.2 }}/2024-01-30-thermostat-head-sonoff-trvzb-zigbee.md %}), interestingly his vision as a novice will offer an interesting experience to those who want to discover the world of home automation, **all without frills.**

## Haade-lab video

For this **second presentation**, [August](/en/author-august/){: target="_blank"} does not hesitate and compares without tongue in cheek 3 thermostatic faucets on the market, [Moes ZTRV-BY -100]({% link _products/{{ page.locale | slice: 0.2 }}//2024-01-30-thermostatic-valve-moes-ztrv-by-100.md %}), [Aqara SRTS- A01]({% link _products/{{ page.locale | slice: 0.2 }}/2024-01-30-thermostatic-head-aqara-srts-a01-e1-zigbee.md %}) and [Sonoff TRVZB ]({% link _products/{{ page.locale | slice: 0.2 }}/2024-01-30-thermostat-head-sonoff-trvzb-zigbee.md %}). As for the comparative article written at the beginning of the year (see below), the result is similar but not always for the same reasons, ***you should find it interesting!***

**At the end of January 2024** I also did a [comparative test of these 3 thermostatic faucets]({% post_url /en/2024-01-29-comparative-thermostat-head-tap-zigbee-xiaomi-sonoff-moes %}) but you may realize that **the video presents other interesting aspects** to take into account.
