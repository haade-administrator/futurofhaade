TL-W5MC1-5V flat shape inductive proximity switch, 30x18x10.5mm, DC NPN NO 5VDC, working voltage 5V, special for MCU.


This inductive sensor powered by 5v can be plugged directly into an esp8266 or wemos d1 module **without the need to install an intermediate resistor.** The reduced dimensions make it an ideal customer for an installation without constraint, all the interest of this model.
