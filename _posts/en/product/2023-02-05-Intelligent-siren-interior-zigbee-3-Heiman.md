The Heiman Zigbee 3.0 smart siren is ideal for sounding an alarm in an emergency.
By combining it with a compatible Zigbee controller, it is possible to include it in your scenarios so that it emits a powerful sound of 95 dB.
For example, it will be possible to trigger the alarm from a motion detector or an opening sensor. A light signal is also present on this siren and will flash when activated.
It incorporates a backup battery, which allows it to be kept active even in the event of a power cut or when it is unplugged thanks to its integrated rechargeable battery.
After power off, the backup battery will start to work for 4 hours continuously.
