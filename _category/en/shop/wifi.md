description: "The main difference of the Wi-Fi standards developed from 2009 is the use of the two frequency bands 2.4 GHz and 5 Ghz. The 802.11n standard thus made it possible to allocate bandwidth according to the use of each device. For example, a computer requiring a better connection would be allocated the 5 GHz bandwidth, and therefore benefit from a better speed, whereas a telephone browsing the Internet would find itself on the 2.4 GHz bandwidth, thus allowing a better range, to be able to move, but a slightly lower flow.

802.11n is the first standard to provide access to broadband and very high speed. Indeed, fixed Internet technologies evolving during the 2000s and 2010s, the 802.11n standard has therefore made it possible to achieve speeds of up to 288 Mb/s over 70 meters thanks to the 2.4 GHz and 600 Mb frequency. /s over 35 meters thanks to the 5 GHz frequency.

Another novelty present on the 802.11n standard is the widened band. Until then, the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz frequency bands were 20 MHz wide. However, a wider band means a better flow of information and therefore a higher throughput. This is why version n of the 802.11 standard could double its bandwidth to 40 MHz. Thus making it possible to double the flow of information circulating."
