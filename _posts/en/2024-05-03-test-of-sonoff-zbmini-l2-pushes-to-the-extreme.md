**Here's a video where you might have a laugh**, with the band **August and Lulu** we all 3 decided to test the Sonoff {{ page.ref }} in a **most extreme way** by pushing it back to its limits.

{% include product-embed.html image="https://i0.wp.com/itead.cc/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ZBMINIL2-1600px-5.jpg?fit=1600%2C1600&ssl=1" title="ZBMINIL2 ExtrÃªme" brand="Sonoff" description="Sonoff zbmini l2 extreme switch module, the smallest on the market" iteadlink="sonoff-zbminil2-extreme-zigbee-smart-switch-no-neutral-required" domlink="devices/6619-sonoff-smart-switch-without-neutral-zigbee-30-zbminil2.html" affiliate="_DkilCPV" %}

According to Sonoff the **Omron relay of {{ page.ref }}** has an electrical resistance of **100,000 actions** and we test this resistance.
And if you watch this video carefully until the end you will be able to get an idea of the solidity of the module.

Personally I know the brand and I think that the {{ page.ref }} will hold, but August thinks the opposite, so who will be right?

## Feedback from {{ page.ref }}

I had **the opportunity to test this module** more than a year ago and we can say that it is one of the best-selling zigbee modules on the market at the moment, certainly a best seller at least for smart switch modules.

## Competition game

As **indicated in the video this test module is up for grabs**, we will organize a draw later. To do this **subscribe to the Haade-lab channel**{: .red} and leave a comment **SEARCHPATATOR**{: .red}.
**And if you are drawn I will send you this head in its original packaging** so don't hesitate to play by upgrading the [Haade-Lab YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcXJ1ZsjEvQxuWJy7gH-A6w){: target="_blank"}.
