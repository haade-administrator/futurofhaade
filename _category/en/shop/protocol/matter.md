description: "Matter is a unified, open-source application-layer connectivity standard built to enable developers and device manufacturers to connect and build reliable, and secure ecosystems and increase compatibility among connected home devices. It is built with market-proven technologies using Internet Protocol (IP) and is compatible with Thread and Wi-Fi network transports. Matter was developed by a Working Group within the Connectivity Standards Alliance (Alliance). This Working Group develops and promotes the adoption of the Matter standard, a royalty-free connectivity standard to increase compatibility among smart home products, with security as a fundamental design tenet. The vision that led major industry players to come together to build Matter is that smart connectivity should be simple, reliable, and interoperable.

Matter simplifies development for manufacturers and increases compatibility for consumers.

The standard was built around a shared belief that smart home devices should be secure, reliable, and seamless to use. By building upon Internet Protocol (IP), Matter enables communication across smart home devices, mobile apps, and cloud services and defines a specific set of IP-based networking technologies for device certification.

The Matter specification details everything necessary to implement a Matter application and transport layer stack. It is intended to be used by implementers as a complete specification.

The Alliance officially opened the Matter Working Group on January 17, 2020, and the specification is available for adoption now."
