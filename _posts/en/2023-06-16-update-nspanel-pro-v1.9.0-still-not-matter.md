**Like every month for a while**, Itead has accustomed us to Nspanel Pro updates. It's time to take an overview of the new features of the **v1.8.0** for the month of May and the latest version of the month of June, version **1.9.0**. I didn't do any articles for v1.8.0 because it *didn't bring any major new features, moreover it's the same for v1.9*, for many months I've been asking myself the question of know [if the EFR32MG21 Zigbee chip can accommodate zigbee/Matter protocols side by side?]({% post_url /en/2022-11-20-zb-dongle-p-vs-zb-dongle-e-zigbee-sonoff %}) Will Itead make it happen?

## Retrospect V1.8.0

At the beginning of May, this version was released, it brings **guest mode and unlocking by password**, but not only.

1. **Improved** management and control capabilities of NSPanel Pro, bringing enhanced functionality.
2. **Guest Mode**- After enabling it, Guest Mode blocks access to certain functions (such as adding devices, setting a timer, etc.). *This feature requires eWeLink APP to be updated to V4.32.0.*
3. **Unlock with password** - Now you have the choice to block access to NSpanel Pro with a simple code.
4. **Optimized firmware update mechanism** – When new firmware is detected, you can check the firmware download process via the download progress bar.
5. Added **S40TPA and S40TPB** modules as thermostat executive devices.

## Conclusion

You will have understood **no big revolutions in these updates**, I also regret that the NSpanel Pro *is managed by the Android system which I find particularly heavy* for this type of device, now we are entitled to ask us the question, whether the next update, which should be version 2.0, will integrate Matter, **[but as explained in a previous article, I very much doubt it?]({% post_url /en/2022-11-20-zb-dongle-p-vs-zb-dongle-e-zigbee-sonoff %})**
