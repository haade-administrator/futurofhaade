## Sonoff TRVZB New Features*

**Enhanced features to better meet users' needs**. The latest updates of SONOFF Zigbee thermostatic radiator valve are as follows:

1. Support for **external temperature sensors (highly anticipated new feature ideal for integrating into Sonoff NSPanel Pro system)** - Receive temperature readings directly from SONOFF Zigbee temperature and humidity sensors such as **SNZB-02**, **SNZB-02P** and **SNZB-02D** to provide accurate and comfortable room temperature, available on SONOFF ZBBridge-P, and will soon work on NSPanel Pro, iHost, ZBBridge-U.
2. **Support Opening Percentage** - Able to control the opening percentage from 0% to 100%, with 1% accuracy to achieve **stable temperature control**, available on SONOFF ZBBridge-P, **NSPanel Pro**, iHost, ZBBridge-U.

{% include product-embed.html image="sonoff-tete-thermostatique-connectee-zigbee-30.jpg" title="Sonoff TRVZB" brand="Sonoff" description="SONOFF Zigbee smart thermostatic head allows you to control the temperature more precisely with less energy, giving you a more comfortable home." domlink="chauffage-clim/6776-sonoff-tete-thermostatique-connectee-zigbee-30.html" iteadlink="sonoff-zigbee-thermostatic-radiator-valve" affiliate="_DFB4iQZ" %}

In addition to these advancements, [SONOFF Zigbee TRVZB](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-thermostatic-radiator-valve/ref/122/){: target="_blank"} has become the brand's **BEST SELLER since September**, building on the increasing European market demand for reels and cost-effective benefits.

**PS:** In the [Sonoff range presentation video](https://youtube.com/live/GP4hubPhlvI){: target="_blank"} I had shown the thermostat integration that only works on one probe, now with the integration of an external thermostat the **trvzb calibration** will be very precise.

## New NSPanel Pro Firmware

{% include product-embed.html image="sonoff-nspanel-pro-120-PW-en-vente.png" title="NSPanel Pro 120 PW" brand="Sonoff" description="Discover the brand new Sonoff NSPanel Pro 120 compatible with wifi and zigbee, a product to have!" iteadlink="sonoff-nspanel-pro-smart-home-control-panel-120-type" %}

In the **next firmware version** of the NSPanel Pro a new feature will be introduced: **Web Shortcut**. This feature will allow you to search for services within the local network and display them on the NSPanel Pro screen, allowing you to consult them at any time.

Compared to **Web Page**, Web Shortcut offers a more convenient way to access local network pages. When you leave the Web Shortcut screen, the page does not close automatically, allowing you to return to it at any time. This makes Web Shortcut ideal for local network pages such as **Home Assistant and iHost CAST**.

> I will have the chance to **test the firmware** next week and I will write an article about this new feature, as well as the integration of the ZTRV thermostat with external sensor support.
